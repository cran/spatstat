  }
  \item{clamp}{
    Logical value indicating how to compute envelopes when
    \code{alternative="less"} or \code{alternative="greater"}.
    Deviations of the observed
    summary function from the theoretical summary function are initially

  }
  \item{maxnerr}{
    Maximum number of rejected patterns.
    If \code{fun} yields a fatal error when applied to a simulated point
    pattern (for example, because the pattern is empty and \code{fun}

    Logical value specifying whether to reject a simulated pattern
    if the resulting values of \code{fun} are all equal to \code{NA},

}
\value{

  Additionally, if \code{savepatterns=TRUE}, the return value has an attribute
  \code{"simpatterns"} which is a list containing the \code{nsim}
  simulated patterns. If \code{savefuns=TRUE}, the return value

  computed for each of the \code{nsim} simulated patterns.
}
\details{
  The \code{envelope} command performs simulations and
  computes envelopes of a summary statistic based on the simulations.
  The result is an object that can be plotted to display the envelopes.
  The envelopes can be used to assess the goodness-of-fit of
  a point process model to point pattern data.

  For the most basic use, if you have a point pattern \code{X} and
  you want to test Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR), type
  \code{plot(envelope(X, Kest,nsim=39))} to see the \eqn{K} function
  for \code{X} plotted together with the envelopes of the
  \eqn{K} function for 39 simulations of CSR. 
  
  The \code{envelope} function is generic, with methods for
  the classes \code{"ppp"}, \code{"ppm"} and \code{"kppm"}
  described here. There are also methods for the classes \code{"pp3"},
  \code{"lpp"} and \code{"lppm"} which are described separately
  under \code{\link{envelope.pp3}} and \code{\link{envelope.lpp}}.
  Envelopes can also be computed from other envelopes, using
  \code{\link{envelope.envelope}}.
  
  To create simulation envelopes, the command \code{envelope(Y, ...)} 
  first generates \code{nsim} random point patterns
  in one of the following ways. 
  \itemize{
    \item 
    If \code{Y} is a point pattern (an object of class \code{"ppp"})
    and \code{simulate=NULL},
    then we generate \code{nsim} simulations of
    Complete Spatial Randomness (i.e. \code{nsim} simulated point patterns
    each being a realisation of the uniform Poisson point process)
    with the same intensity as the pattern \code{Y}.
    (If \code{Y} is a multitype point pattern, then the simulated patterns
    are also given independent random marks; the probability
    distribution of the random marks is determined by the
    relative frequencies of marks in \code{Y}.)
    \item
    If \code{Y} is a fitted point process model (an object of class
    \code{"ppm"} or \code{"kppm"}) and \code{simulate=NULL},
    then this routine generates \code{nsim} simulated
    realisations of that model.
    \item
    If \code{simulate} is supplied, then it determines how the
    simulated point patterns are generated. It may be either
    \itemize{
      \item
      an expression in the R language, typically containing a call
      to a random generator. This expression will be evaluated
      \code{nsim} times to yield \code{nsim} point patterns. For example
      if \code{simulate=expression(runifpoint(100))} then each simulated
      pattern consists of exactly 100 independent uniform random points.
      \item
      a function in the R language, typically containing a call to a
      random generator. This function will be applied repeatedly
      to the original data pattern \code{Y} to yield \code{nsim} point
      patterns. For example if \code{simulate=\link{rlabel}} then each
      simulated pattern was generated by evaluating \code{\link{rlabel}(Y)}
      and consists of a randomly-relabelled version of \code{Y}.
      \item
      a list of point patterns.
      The entries in this list will be taken as the simulated patterns.
      \item
      an object of class \code{"envelope"}. This should have been
      produced by calling \code{envelope} with the
      argument \code{savepatterns=TRUE}.
      The simulated point patterns that were saved in this object
      will be extracted and used as the simulated patterns for the
      new envelope computation. This makes it possible to plot envelopes
      for two different summary functions based on exactly the same set of
      simulated point patterns.
      }
  }
  
  The summary statistic \code{fun} is applied to each of these simulated
  patterns. Typically \code{fun} is one of the functions
  \code{Kest}, \code{Gest}, \code{Fest}, \code{Jest}, \code{pcf},
  \code{Kcross}, \code{Kdot}, \code{Gcross}, \code{Gdot},
  \code{Jcross}, \code{Jdot}, \code{Kmulti}, \code{Gmulti},
  \code{Jmulti} or \code{Kinhom}. It may also be a character string
  containing the name of one of these functions.

  The statistic \code{fun} can also be a user-supplied function;
  if so, then it must have arguments \code{X} and \code{r}
  like those in the functions listed above, and it must return an object
  of class \code{"fv"}.

  Upper and lower critical envelopes are computed in one of the following ways:
  \describe{
    \item{pointwise:}{by default, envelopes are calculated pointwise
      (i.e. for each value of the distance argument \eqn{r}), by sorting the
      \code{nsim} simulated values, and taking the \code{m}-th lowest
      and \code{m}-th highest values, where \code{m = nrank}.
      For example if \code{nrank=1}, the upper and lower envelopes
      are the pointwise maximum and minimum of the simulated values.

      The pointwise envelopes are \bold{not} \dQuote{confidence bands}
      for the true value of the function! Rather,
      they specify the critical points for a Monte Carlo test
      (Ripley, 1981). The test is constructed by choosing a
      \emph{fixed} value of \eqn{r}, and rejecting the null hypothesis if the
      observed function value
      lies outside the envelope \emph{at this value of} \eqn{r}.
      This test has exact significance level
      \code{alpha = 2 * nrank/(1 + nsim)}.
    }
    \item{simultaneous:}{if \code{global=TRUE}, then the envelopes are
      determined as follows. First we calculate the theoretical mean value of
      the summary statistic (if we are testing CSR, the theoretical
      value is supplied by \code{fun}; otherwise we perform a separate
      set of \code{nsim2} simulations, compute the
      average of all these simulated values, and take this average
      as an estimate of the theoretical mean value). Then, for each simulation,
      we compare the simulated curve to the theoretical curve, and compute the
      maximum absolute difference between them (over the interval
      of \eqn{r} values specified by \code{ginterval}). This gives a
      deviation value \eqn{d_i}{d[i]} for each of the \code{nsim}
      simulations. Finally we take the \code{m}-th largest of the
      deviation values, where \code{m=nrank}, and call this
      \code{dcrit}. Then the simultaneous envelopes are of the form
      \code{lo = expected - dcrit} and \code{hi = expected + dcrit} where
      \code{expected} is either the theoretical mean value \code{theo}
      (if we are testing CSR) or the estimated theoretical value
      \code{mmean} (if we are testing another model). The simultaneous critical
      envelopes have constant width \code{2 * dcrit}.

      The simultaneous critical envelopes allow us to perform a different
      Monte Carlo test (Ripley, 1981). The test rejects the null
      hypothesis if the graph of the observed function
      lies outside the envelope \bold{at any value of} \eqn{r}.
      This test has exact significance level
      \code{alpha = nrank/(1 + nsim)}.

      This test can also be performed using \code{\link{mad.test}}.
    }
    \item{based on sample moments:}{if \code{VARIANCE=TRUE},
      the algorithm calculates the
      (pointwise) sample mean and sample variance of
      the simulated functions. Then the envelopes are computed
      as mean plus or minus \code{nSD} standard deviations.
      These envelopes do not have an exact significance interpretation.
      They are a naive approximation to
      the critical points of the Neyman-Pearson test
      assuming the summary statistic is approximately Normally
      distributed.
    }
  }
  
  The return value is an object of class \code{"fv"} containing
  the summary function for the data point pattern,
  the upper and lower simulation envelopes, and 
  the theoretical expected value (exact or estimated) of the summary function 
  for the model being tested. It can be plotted
  using \code{\link{plot.envelope}}.

  If \code{VARIANCE=TRUE} then the return value also includes the
  sample mean, sample variance and other quantities.

  Arguments can be passed to the function \code{fun} through
  \code{...}. This means that you simply specify these arguments in the call to
  \code{envelope}, and they will be passed to \code{fun}.
  In particular, the argument \code{correction}
  determines the edge correction to be used to calculate the summary
  statistic. See the section on Edge Corrections, and the Examples.

  Arguments can also be passed to the function \code{fun}
  through the list \code{funargs}. This mechanism is typically used if
  an argument of \code{fun} has the same name as an argument of
  \code{envelope}. The list \code{funargs} should contain
  entries of the form \code{name=value}, where each \code{name} is the name
  of an argument of \code{fun}.

  There is also an option, rarely used, in which different function
  arguments are used when computing the summary function
  for the data \code{Y} and for the simulated patterns.
  If \code{funYargs} is given, it will be used
  when the summary function for the data \code{Y} is computed,
  while \code{funargs} will be used when computing the summary function
  for the simulated patterns.
  This option is only needed in rare cases: usually the basic principle
  requires that the data and simulated patterns must be treated
  equally, so that \code{funargs} and \code{funYargs} should be identical.

  If \code{Y} is a fitted cluster point process model (object of
  class \code{"kppm"}), and \code{simulate=NULL},
  then the model is simulated directly
  using \code{\link{simulate.kppm}}.
  
  If \code{Y} is a fitted Gibbs point process model (object of
  class \code{"ppm"}), and \code{simulate=NULL},
  then the model is simulated
  by running the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \code{\link{rmh}}.
  Complete control over this algorithm is provided by the 
  arguments \code{start} and \code{control} which are passed
  to \code{\link{rmh}}.

  For simultaneous critical envelopes (\code{global=TRUE})
  the following options are also useful:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{ginterval}}{determines the interval of \eqn{r} values
      over which the deviation between curves is calculated.
      It should be a numeric vector of length 2.
      There is a sensible default (namely, the recommended plotting
      interval for \code{fun(X)}, or the range of \code{r} values if
      \code{r} is explicitly specified).
    }
    \item{\code{transform}}{specifies a transformation of the
      summary function \code{fun} that will be carried out before the
      deviations are computed.
      Such transforms are useful if \code{global=TRUE} or
      \code{VARIANCE=TRUE}.
      The \code{transform} must be an expression object
      using the symbol \code{.} to represent the function value
      (and possibly other symbols recognised by \code{\link{with.fv}}).
      For example, 
      the conventional way to normalise the \eqn{K} function
      (Ripley, 1981) is to transform it to the \eqn{L} function
      \eqn{L(r) = \sqrt{K(r)/\pi}}{L(r) = sqrt(K(r)/\pi)}
      and this is implemented by setting
      \code{transform=expression(sqrt(./pi))}.
    }
  }

  It is also possible to extract the summary functions for each of the
  individual simulated point patterns, by setting \code{savefuns=TRUE}.
  Then the return value also 
  has an attribute \code{"simfuns"} containing all the 
  summary functions for the individual simulated patterns.
  It is an \code{"fv"} object containing
  functions named \code{sim1, sim2, ...} representing the \code{nsim}
  summary functions.

  It is also possible to save the simulated point patterns themselves,
  by setting \code{savepatterns=TRUE}. Then the return value also has
  an attribute \code{"simpatterns"} which is a list of length
  \code{nsim} containing all the simulated point patterns.

  See \code{\link{plot.envelope}} and \code{\link{plot.fv}}
  for information about how to plot the envelopes.

  Different envelopes can be recomputed from the same data
  using \code{\link{envelope.envelope}}.
  Envelopes can be combined using \code{\link{pool.envelope}}.
}
\section{Errors and warnings}{
  An error may be generated if one of the simulations produces a
  point pattern that is empty, or is otherwise unacceptable to the
  function \code{fun}.
  
  The upper envelope may be \code{NA} (plotted as plus or minus
  infinity) if some of the function values
  computed for the simulated point patterns are \code{NA}.
  Whether this occurs will depend on the function \code{fun},
  but it usually happens when the simulated point pattern does not contain
  enough points to compute a meaningful value.
}
\section{Confidence intervals}{
  Simulation envelopes do \bold{not} compute confidence intervals;
  they generate significance bands. 
  If you really need a confidence interval for the true summary function
  of the point process, use \code{\link{lohboot}}.
  See also \code{\link{varblock}}.
}
\section{Edge corrections}{
  It is common to apply a correction for edge effects when
  calculating a summary function such as the \eqn{K} function.
  Typically the user has a choice between several possible edge
  corrections.
  In a call to \code{envelope}, the user can specify the edge correction
  to be applied in \code{fun}, using the argument \code{correction}.
  See the Examples below.

  \describe{
    \item{Summary functions in \pkg{spatstat}}{
      Summary functions that are available in \pkg{spatstat}, such as
      \code{\link{Kest}}, \code{\link{Gest}} and \code{\link{pcf}},
      have a standard argument called \code{correction} which specifies
      the name of one or more edge corrections.

      The list of available edge
      corrections is different for each summary function,
      and may also depend on the kind of window in which the point pattern is
      recorded.
      In the
      case of \code{Kest} (the default and most frequently used value of
      \code{fun}) the best edge correction is Ripley's isotropic
      correction if the window is rectangular or polygonal, 
      and the translation correction if the window is a binary mask.
      See the help files for the individual
      functions for more information.
      
      All the summary functions in \pkg{spatstat}
      recognise the option \code{correction="best"}
      which gives the \dQuote{best} (most accurate) available edge correction
      for that function. 

      In a call to \code{envelope}, if \code{fun} is one of the
      summary functions provided in \pkg{spatstat}, then the default
      is \code{correction="best"}. This means that
      \emph{by default, the envelope will be computed
	using the \dQuote{best} available edge correction}.

      The user can override this default by specifying the argument

      If \code{fun} is a function written by the user,
      then \code{envelope} has to guess what to do.

      If \code{fun} has an argument
      called \code{correction}, or has \code{\dots} arguments,
      then \code{envelope} assumes that the function 
      can handle a correction argument. To compute the envelope,
      \code{fun} will be called with a \code{correction} argument.
      The default is \code{correction="best"}, unless
      overridden in the call to \code{envelope}.

      Otherwise, if \code{fun} does not have an argument
      called \code{correction} and does not have \code{\dots} arguments,
      then \code{envelope} assumes that the function 
      \emph{cannot} handle a correction argument. To compute the
      envelope, \code{fun} is called without a correction argument.
