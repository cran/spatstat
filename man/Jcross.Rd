\details{
  This function \code{Jcross} and its companions
  \code{\link{Jdot}} and \code{\link{Jmulti}}
  are generalisations of the function \code{\link{Jest}}
  to multitype point patterns. 

  A multitype point pattern is a spatial pattern of
  points classified into a finite number of possible
  ``colours'' or ``types''. In the \pkg{spatstat} package,
  a multitype pattern is represented as a single 
  point pattern object in which the points carry marks,
  and the mark value attached to each point
  determines the type of that point.
  
  The argument \code{X} must be a point pattern (object of class
  \code{"ppp"}) or any data that are acceptable to \code{\link{as.ppp}}.
  It must be a marked point pattern, and the mark vector
  \code{X$marks} must be a factor.
  The argument \code{i} will be interpreted as a
  level of the factor \code{X$marks}. (Warning: this means that
  an integer value \code{i=3} will be interpreted as the number 3,
  \bold{not} the 3rd smallest level).
  
  The ``type \eqn{i} to type \eqn{j}'' multitype \eqn{J} function 
  of a stationary multitype point process \eqn{X}
  was introduced by Van lieshout and Baddeley (1999). It is defined by
  \deqn{J_{ij}(r) = \frac{1 - G_{ij}(r)}{1 -
      F_{j}(r)}}{Jij(r) = (1 - Gij(r))/(1-Fj(r))}
  where \eqn{G_{ij}(r)}{Gij(r)} is the distribution function of
  the distance from a type \eqn{i} point to the nearest point of type \eqn{j},
  and \eqn{F_{j}(r)}{Fj(r)} is the distribution
  function of the distance from a fixed point in space to the nearest
  point of type \eqn{j} in the pattern.

  An estimate of \eqn{J_{ij}(r)}{Jij(r)}
  is a useful summary statistic in exploratory data analysis
  of a multitype point pattern. 
  If the subprocess of type \eqn{i} points is independent
  of the subprocess of points of type \eqn{j},
  then \eqn{J_{ij}(r) \equiv 1}{Jij(r) = 1}.
  Hence deviations of the empirical estimate of
  \eqn{J_{ij}}{Jij} from the value 1
  may suggest dependence between types.

  This algorithm estimates \eqn{J_{ij}(r)}{Jij(r)} 
  from the point pattern \code{X}. It assumes that \code{X} can be treated
  as a realisation of a stationary (spatially homogeneous) 
  random spatial point process in the plane, observed through
  a bounded window.
  The window (which is specified in \code{X} as \code{Window(X)})
  may have arbitrary shape.
  Biases due to edge effects are
  treated in the same manner as in \code{\link{Jest}},
  using the Kaplan-Meier and border corrections.
  The main work is done by \code{\link{Gmulti}} and \code{\link{Fest}}.

  The argument \code{r} is the vector of values for the
  distance \eqn{r} at which \eqn{J_{ij}(r)}{Jij(r)} should be evaluated. 
  The values of \eqn{r} must be increasing nonnegative numbers
  and the maximum \eqn{r} value must not exceed the radius of the
  largest disc contained in the window.

  The arguments \code{i} and \code{j} are always interpreted as
  levels of the factor \code{X$marks}. They are converted to character
  strings if they are not already character strings.
  The value \code{i=1} does \bold{not}
  refer to the first level of the factor.
