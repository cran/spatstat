\details{
  This is a generalisation of the function \code{\link{Kcross}}
  to include an adjustment for spatially inhomogeneous intensity,
  in a manner similar to the function \code{\link{Kinhom}}.

  The inhomogeneous cross-type \eqn{K} function is described by
  \Moller and Waagepetersen (2003, pages 48-49 and 51-53).
  
  Briefly, given a multitype point process, suppose the sub-process
  of points of type \eqn{j} has intensity function
  \eqn{\lambda_j(u)}{lambda[j](u)} at spatial locations \eqn{u}.
  Suppose we place a mass of \eqn{1/\lambda_j(\zeta)}{1/lambda[j](z)}
  at each point \eqn{\zeta}{z} of type \eqn{j}. Then the expected total
  mass per unit area is 1. The
  inhomogeneous ``cross-type'' \eqn{K} function 
  \eqn{K_{ij}^{\mbox{inhom}}(r)}{K[ij]inhom(r)} equals the expected
  total mass within a radius \eqn{r} of a point of the process
  of type \eqn{i}. 
  
  If the process of type \eqn{i} points
  were independent of the process of type \eqn{j} points,
  then \eqn{K_{ij}^{\mbox{inhom}}(r)}{K[ij]inhom(r)}
  would equal \eqn{\pi r^2}{pi * r^2}.
  Deviations between the empirical \eqn{K_{ij}}{Kij} curve
  and the theoretical curve \eqn{\pi r^2}{pi * r^2} 
  suggest dependence between the points of types \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}.

  The argument \code{X} must be a point pattern (object of class
  \code{"ppp"}) or any data that are acceptable to \code{\link{as.ppp}}.
  It must be a marked point pattern, and the mark vector
  \code{X$marks} must be a factor.

  The arguments \code{i} and \code{j} will be interpreted as
  levels of the factor \code{X$marks}. (Warning: this means that
  an integer value \code{i=3} will be interpreted as the number 3,
  \bold{not} the 3rd smallest level).
  If \code{i} and \code{j} are missing, they default to the first
  and second level of the marks factor, respectively.

  The argument \code{lambdaI} supplies the values
  of the intensity of the sub-process of points of type \code{i}.
  It may be either
  \describe{
    \item{a pixel image}{(object of class \code{"im"}) which
      gives the values of the type \code{i} intensity
      at all locations in the window containing \code{X};
    }
    \item{a numeric vector}{containing the values of the
      type \code{i} intensity evaluated only
      at the data points of type \code{i}. The length of this vector
      must equal the number of type \code{i} points in \code{X}.
    }
    \item{a function}{
      which can be evaluated to give values of the intensity at
      any locations.
    }
     \item{a fitted point process model}{
      (object of class \code{"ppm"}, \code{"kppm"} or \code{"dppm"})
      whose fitted \emph{trend} can be used as the fitted intensity.
      (If \code{update=TRUE} the model will first be refitted to the
      data \code{X} before the trend is computed.)
    }
    \item{omitted:}{
      if \code{lambdaI} is omitted then it will be estimated
      using a leave-one-out kernel smoother. 
    }
  }
  If \code{lambdaI} is omitted, then it will be estimated using
  a `leave-one-out' kernel smoother,
  as described in Baddeley, \Moller 
  and Waagepetersen (2000).  The estimate of \code{lambdaI} for a given
  point is computed by removing the point from the
  point pattern, applying kernel smoothing to the remaining points using
  \code{\link{density.ppp}}, and evaluating the smoothed intensity
  at the point in question. The smoothing kernel bandwidth is controlled
  by the arguments \code{sigma} and \code{varcov}, which are passed to
  \code{\link{density.ppp}} along with any extra arguments.

  Similarly \code{lambdaJ} should contain
  estimated values of the intensity of the sub-process of points of
  type \code{j}. It may be either a pixel image, a function,
  a numeric vector, or omitted.
  
  Alternatively if the argument \code{lambdaX} is given, then it specifies
  the intensity values for all points of \code{X}, and the
  arguments \code{lambdaI}, \code{lambdaJ} will be ignored.
  
  The optional argument \code{lambdaIJ} is for advanced use only.
  It is a matrix containing estimated
  values of the products of these two intensities for each pair of
  data points of types \code{i} and \code{j} respectively.
  
  The argument \code{r} is the vector of values for the
  distance \eqn{r} at which \eqn{K_{ij}(r)}{Kij(r)} should be evaluated. 
  The values of \eqn{r} must be increasing nonnegative numbers
  and the maximum \eqn{r} value must not exceed the radius of the
  largest disc contained in the window.

  The argument \code{correction} chooses the edge correction
  as explained e.g. in \code{\link{Kest}}.

  The pair correlation function can also be applied to the
  result of \code{Kcross.inhom}; see \code{\link{pcf}}.
