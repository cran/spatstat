\details{
  This function \code{Jdot} and its companions
  \code{\link{Jcross}} and \code{\link{Jmulti}}
  are generalisations of the function \code{\link{Jest}}
  to multitype point patterns. 

  A multitype point pattern is a spatial pattern of
  points classified into a finite number of possible
  ``colours'' or ``types''. In the \pkg{spatstat} package,
  a multitype pattern is represented as a single 
  point pattern object in which the points carry marks,
  and the mark value attached to each point
  determines the type of that point.
  
  The argument \code{X} must be a point pattern (object of class
  \code{"ppp"}) or any data that are acceptable to \code{\link{as.ppp}}.
  It must be a marked point pattern, and the mark vector
  \code{X$marks} must be a factor.
  The argument \code{i} will be interpreted as a
  level of the factor \code{X$marks}. (Warning: this means that
  an integer value \code{i=3} will be interpreted as the number 3,
  \bold{not} the 3rd smallest level.)
  
  The ``type \eqn{i} to any type'' multitype \eqn{J} function 
  of a stationary multitype point process \eqn{X}
  was introduced by Van lieshout and Baddeley (1999). It is defined by
  \deqn{J_{i\bullet}(r) = \frac{1 - G_{i\bullet}(r)}{1 -
      F_{\bullet}(r)}}{Ji.(r) = (1 - Gi.(r))/(1-F.(r))}
  where \eqn{G_{i\bullet}(r)}{Gi.(r)} is the distribution function of
  the distance from a type \eqn{i} point to the nearest other point
  of the pattern, and \eqn{F_{\bullet}(r)}{F.(r)} is the distribution
  function of the distance from a fixed point in space to the nearest
  point of the pattern.

  An estimate of \eqn{J_{i\bullet}(r)}{Ji.(r)}
  is a useful summary statistic in exploratory data analysis
  of a multitype point pattern. If the pattern is 
  a marked Poisson point process, then
  \eqn{J_{i\bullet}(r) \equiv 1}{Ji.(r) = 1}.
  If the subprocess of type \eqn{i} points is independent
  of the subprocess of points of all types not equal to \eqn{i},
  then \eqn{J_{i\bullet}(r)}{Ji.(r)} equals
  \eqn{J_{ii}(r)}{Jii(r)}, the ordinary \eqn{J} function
  (see \code{\link{Jest}} and Van Lieshout and Baddeley (1996))
  of the points of type \eqn{i}. 
  Hence deviations from zero of the empirical estimate of
  \eqn{J_{i\bullet} - J_{ii}}{Ji.-Jii} 
  may suggest dependence between types.

  This algorithm estimates \eqn{J_{i\bullet}(r)}{Ji.(r)} 
  from the point pattern \code{X}. It assumes that \code{X} can be treated
  as a realisation of a stationary (spatially homogeneous) 
  random spatial point process in the plane, observed through
  a bounded window.
  The window (which is specified in \code{X} as \code{Window(X)})
  may have arbitrary shape.
  Biases due to edge effects are
  treated in the same manner as in \code{\link{Jest}},
  using the Kaplan-Meier and border corrections.
  The main work is done by \code{\link{Gmulti}} and \code{\link{Fest}}.

  The argument \code{r} is the vector of values for the
  distance \eqn{r} at which \eqn{J_{i\bullet}(r)}{Ji.(r)} should be evaluated. 
  The values of \eqn{r} must be increasing nonnegative numbers
  and the maximum \eqn{r} value must not exceed the radius of the
  largest disc contained in the window.
