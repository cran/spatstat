\title{
  Hybrid Interaction Point Process Model
}
\description{
  Creates an instance of a hybrid point process model
  which can then be fitted to point pattern data.
}
\usage{
Hybrid(...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{\dots}{
    Two or more interactions (objects of class \code{"interact"})
    or objects which can be converted to interactions.
    See Details.
  }
}
\details{
  A \emph{hybrid} (Baddeley, Turner, Mateu and Bevan, 2013)
  is a point process model created by combining two or more
  point process models, or an interpoint interaction created by combining
  two or more interpoint interactions.
  
  The \emph{hybrid} of two point processes, with probability densities
  \eqn{f(x)} and \eqn{g(x)} respectively,
  is the point process with probability density 
  \deqn{h(x) = c \, f(x) \, g(x)}{h(x) = c * f(x) * g(x)}
  where \eqn{c} is a normalising constant.

  Equivalently, the hybrid of two point processes with conditional intensities
  \eqn{\lambda(u,x)}{lambda(u,x)} and \eqn{\kappa(u,x)}{kappa(u,x)}
  is the point process with conditional intensity
  \deqn{
    \phi(u,x) = \lambda(u,x) \, \kappa(u,x).
  }{
    phi(u,x) = lambda(u,x) * kappa(u,x).
  }
  The hybrid of \eqn{m > 3} point processes is defined in a similar way.
  
  The function \code{\link{ppm}}, which fits point process models to 
  point pattern data, requires an argument 
  of class \code{"interact"} describing the interpoint interaction
  structure of the model to be fitted. 
  The appropriate description of a hybrid interaction is
  yielded by the function \code{Hybrid()}. 
  
  The arguments \code{\dots} will be interpreted as interpoint interactions
  (objects of class \code{"interact"}) and the result will be the hybrid
  of these interactions. Each argument must either be an
  interpoint interaction (object of class \code{"interact"}),
  or a point process model (object of class \code{"ppm"}) from which the
  interpoint interaction will be extracted.

  The arguments \code{\dots} may also be given in the form
  \code{name=value}. This is purely cosmetic: it can be used to attach
  simple mnemonic names to the component interactions, and makes the
  printed output from \code{\link{print.ppm}} neater.
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{"interact"}
  describing an interpoint interaction structure.
