\section{\pkg{spatstat} is splitting into parts}

    \pkg{spatstat} is being split into several sub-packages, to satisfy
    the requirements of CRAN. This should not affect the user:
    existing code will continue to work in the same way.

    Currently there are three sub-packages, called 
    \pkg{spatstat.utils},
    \pkg{spatstat.data} 
    and \pkg{spatstat}.

    Typing \code{library(spatstat)} will load the familiar
    \pkg{spatstat} package which can be used as before.
    This will automatically load the \pkg{spatstat.data} package 
    and will silently ``import'' the \pkg{spatstat.utils} package.

    The \pkg{spatstat.data} package now contains all the datasets
    for \pkg{spatstat}.
    
    The \pkg{spatstat.utils} package
    contains utility functions that were originally written for \pkg{spatstat}:
    they were undocumented internal functions in \pkg{spatstat}, but are now
    documented and accessible in a separate package because they may be
    useful for other purposes. To access these functions, you need to
    type \code{library(spatstat.utils)}.

    fixed in \texttt{spatstat {#3}}, {#4})}%
}
  
\begin{itemize}
  
  %% LEVEL 1: always completely wrong, broad impact
  
\item \texttt{nncross.ppp}:
  Results were completely incorrect if $k > 1$.
  \bugger{1.31-2}{april 2013}{1.35-0}{december 2013}

\item \texttt{nncross.pp3}:
  Results were completely incorrect in some cases.
  \bugger{1.32-0}{august 2013}{1.34-0}{october 2013}

 \item \texttt{cdf.test.ppm}:
    Calculation of $p$-values was incorrect for Gibbs models: 
    $1-p$ was computed instead of $p$.
  \bugger{1.40-0}{december 2014}{1.45-2}{may 2016}

\item \texttt{Smooth.ppp}:
  Results of \verb!Smooth(X, at="points", leaveoneout=FALSE)!
  were completely incorrect.
  \bugger{1.20-5}{august 2010}{1.46-0}{july 2016}
  
\item \texttt{rmh}:
  
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Simulation was completely incorrect in the case of 
     a multitype point process with an interaction that does not depend
     on the marks, such as \verb!ppm(betacells, ~marks, Strauss(60))!
     due to a coding error in the \texttt{C} interface.
     \bugger{1.22-3}{march 2010}{1.22-3}{june 2011}
   \item 
     Simulation of the Area-Interaction model was completely incorrect.
     \bugger{1.23-6}{october 2011}{1.31-0}{january 2013}
   \item 
     Simulation of the Geyer saturation process was completely incorrect.
     \bugger{1.31-0}{january 2013}{1.31-1}{march 2013}
   \item 
     Simulation of the Strauss-Hard Core process was partially incorrect,
     giving point patterns with a slightly lower intensity.
     \bugger{1.31-0}{january 2013}{1.37-0}{may 2014}
   \item
   The result of simulating a model with a hard core
   did not necessarily respect the hard core constraint,
   and simulation of a model with strong inhibition
   did not necessarily converge. 
   This only happened if the first order trend was large,
   the starting state (\texttt{n.start} or \texttt{x.start}) was not given,
   and the number of iterations \texttt{nrep} was not very large.
   It occurred because of a poor choice for the default starting state.
   {\small (Bug was present since about 2010.  
     Fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.40-0}, december 2014)}
   \item 
     Simulation was incorrect in the case of an inhomogeneous multitype model
     with \texttt{fixall=TRUE} (i.e.\ with a fixed number of points 
     of each type) if the model was segregated (i.e.\ if different types
     of points had different first order trend). 
     The effect of the error was that all types of points
     had the same first order trend.
     {\small (Bug was present since about 2010.
       Fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.43-0}, september 2015)}
  \item 
     Simulation of the Geyer saturation process was 
     incorrectly initialised, so that the results of a short run 
     (i.e. small value of \texttt{nrep}) were incorrect, 
     while long runs were correct.
     \bugger{1.17-0}{october 2009}{1.31-1}{march 2013}
   \end{itemize}

 \item \texttt{rVarGamma}:
   Simulations were incorrect; they were generated using the wrong value
   of the parameter \texttt{nu.ker}.  
   \bugger{1.25-0}{december 2011}{1.35-0}{december 2013}

 \item \texttt{rCauchy}:

   of the parameter \texttt{omega}.
   \bugger{1.25-0}{december 2011}{1.25-2}{january 2012}
   
 \item \texttt{lppm}:
   For multitype patterns, the fitted model was completely incorrect
   due to an error in constructing the quadrature scheme.
   \bugger{1.23-0}{july 2011}{1.30-0}{december 2012}
   
 \item \verb![.lpp!:
   The local coordinate \texttt{seg} was completely incorrect,

   %% LEVEL 2: often completely wrong, moderate impact
   
 \item \texttt{bw.pcf}:

   \bugger{1.35-0}{december 2013}{1.55-0}{january 2018}   

 \item \texttt{vcov.mppm}:
    Format was incorrect (rows/columns were omitted) in some cases.
   \bugger{1.45-1}{may 2016}{1.55-0}{january 2018}   

  \item \texttt{model.matrix.ppm}, \texttt{model.frame.ppm}:
    Values were sometimes incorrect when applied to the result of
    \texttt{subfits}.
    To be precise, if \texttt{fit} was an \texttt{mppm}
    object fitted to a hyperframe
    that included ``design covariates'' (covariates that take a constant value
    in each row of the hyperframe), and if \verb!futs <- subfits(fit)!, then
    \verb!model.matrix(futs[[i]])! gave incorrect values in the columns
    corresponding to the design covariates. 
    \bugger{1.45-1}{may 2016}{1.55-0}{january 2018}   
   
 \item \texttt{predict.rho2hat}:

\item \texttt{envelope.ppm}:
   If the model was an inhomogeneous Poisson process, 
   the resulting envelope object was incorrect
   (the simulations were correct, but the envelopes were calculated
   assuming the model was CSR). 
   \bugger{1.23-5}{september 2011}{1.23-6}{october 2011}

 \item \texttt{linearK}, \texttt{linearpcf},
   \texttt{linearKinhom}, \texttt{linearpcfinhom}
   and multitype versions:
    These functions were sometimes greatly underestimated
    when the network had segments shorter than 10 coordinate units.
   \bugger{1.44-0}{december 2015}{1.46-2}{july 2016}

 \item \texttt{nncross}, \texttt{distfun}, \texttt{AreaInter}:
  Results of \texttt{nncross} were possibly incorrect 
  when \code{X} and \code{Y} did not have the same window. 
  This bug affected values of \texttt{distfun} and may also 
  have affected ppm objects with interaction \texttt{AreaInter}.
  \bugger{1.9-4}{june 2006}{1.25-2}{january 2012}

 \item \texttt{update.kppm}:

     were given.
     \bugger{1.42-2}{june 2015}{1.54-0}{november 2017}
   \item 
  If the call to \texttt{update} did not include a formula argument
   or a point pattern argument, then all arguments were ignored. 
   Example: \texttt{update(fit, improve.type="quasi")} was identical to 
   \texttt{fit}.
   \bugger{1.42-2}{june 2015}{1.45-0}{march 2016}
   \end{itemize}

  \item \texttt{markcorrint}:

    In dimensions higher than 2, the result was shifted so that
    it was centred at the origin.
    \bugger{1.54-0}{december 2017}{1.55-0}{january 2018}   

\item \texttt{density.ppp}:
  Values of \verb!density(X, at="points")!
  and \verb!Smooth(X, at="points")!
  were sometimes incorrect, due to omission of
  the contribution from the data point with the smallest $x$ coordinate.
  \bugger{1.26-0}{april 2012}{1.46-1}{july 2016}
  
 \item \texttt{update.ppm}:
   If the argument \texttt{Q} was given,

   \bugger{1.38-0}{august 2014}{1.38-1}{august 2014}

\item \texttt{subfits}:
    The interaction coefficients of the submodels were incorrect

     {\small (Bug was present since about 2010.
       Fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.48-0}, december 2016)}
   
 \item \texttt{kppm}, \texttt{matclust.estpcf}, \texttt{pcfmodel}:
    The pair correlation function of the M\'atern Cluster Process
    was evaluated incorrectly at distances close to 0.
    This could have affected the fitted parameters 
    in \texttt{matclust.estpcf()} or \texttt{kppm(clusters="MatClust")}.
    \bugger{1.20-2}{august 2010}{1.33-0}{september 2013}
    
 \item \texttt{ppm}:

 \item \texttt{clip.infline}: 
   Results were incorrect unless the midpoint of the window
   was the coordinate origin.
   \bugger{1.15-1}{april 2009}{1.48-0}{december 2016}
   
 \item \texttt{intensity.ppm}:
   Result was incorrect for Gibbs models if the model was 
    exactly equivalent to a Poisson process (i.e. if all interaction
    coefficients were exactly zero).
   \bugger{1.28-1}{june 2012}{1.47-0}{october 2016}
   
 \item \texttt{funxy}: 
   Did not correctly handle one-line functions.

   \bugger{1.45-1}{may 2016}{1.55-0}{january 2018}   

\item \texttt{density.ppp}:
  If the smoothing bandwidth \texttt{sigma} was very small 
  (e.g.\ less than the width of a pixel), 
  results were inaccurate if the default resolution was used,
  and completely incorrect if a user-specified resolution was given.
  \bugger{1.26-0}{april 2012}{1.52-0}{august 2017}
  
 \item \texttt{selfcrossing.psp}:
   $y$ coordinate values were incorrect.   
   \bugger{1.23-2}{august 2011}{1.25-3}{february 2012}

   correction.
   \bugger{1.25-0}{december 2011}{1.54-0}{november 2017}

   for marked point process models.   
   \bugger{1.27-0}{may 2012}{1.29-0}{october 2012}
   
 \item \texttt{diagnose.ppm}:
   When applied to a model obtained from \texttt{subfits()}, 
   in the default case (\texttt{oldstyle=FALSE}) 
   the variance calculations were incorrect.
   Consequently the dotted lines representing significance bands were 
   incorrect. An error or warning about negative variances occurred sometimes.
   However, calculations with \texttt{oldstyle=TRUE} were correct.
   The default has now been changed to \texttt{oldstyle=TRUE} for such models.
   \bugger{1.35-0}{december 2013}{1.45-0}{march 2016}

 \item \texttt{Smooth.ppp}:
   Results for \verb!at="points"! were garbled, for some values of 
   \texttt{sigma}, if \texttt{X} had more than one column of marks.
   \bugger{1.38-0}{october 2014}{1.46-0}{july 2016}
    
 \item \texttt{linearK}, \texttt{linearKinhom}:
   If any data points were located exactly at a vertex of the 
   linear network, the weights for Ang's correction were incorrect, 
   due to numerical error. This sometimes produced infinite 
   or NA values of the linear $K$ function.  
   \bugger{1.23-0}{july 2011}{1.27-0}{may 2012}

 \item \texttt{Kinhom}, \texttt{Linhom}:

   Calculations were incorrect if \texttt{lambda} was a fitted point
   process model.
   \bugger{1.38-0}{august 2014}{1.38-1}{august 2014}
     
 \item \texttt{integral.linim}, \texttt{integral.linfun}:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item 
   results were inaccurate because of a bias in the distribution of
   sample points.
   \bugger{1.41-0}{february 2015}{1.47-0}{october 2016}
   \item 
   results were inaccurate if many of the segment lengths were
   shorter than the width of a pixel.

    \item 
   results were wildly inaccurate in some extreme cases where many segments

   \bugger{1.41-0}{february 2015}{1.54-0}{november 2017}
   \end{itemize}
   
 \item \texttt{predict.ppm}:
   Calculation of the conditional intensity omitted the edge correction
   if \texttt{correction='translate'} or \texttt{correction='periodic'}. 
   \bugger{1.17-0}{october 2009}{1.31-3}{may 2013}

 \item \texttt{varblock}:
   Calculations were incorrect if more than one column of 
   edge corrections was computed. 
   \bugger{1.21-1}{november 2010}{1.39-0}{october 2014}
   
 \item \texttt{scan.test}
   Results were sometimes incorrect due to numerical instability
   (a 'Gibbs phenomenon').    
   \bugger{1.24-1}{october 2011}{1.26-1}{april 2012}

 \item \texttt{relrisk}:
   When \verb!at="pixels"!, a small fraction of pixel values were sometimes
   wildly inaccurate, due to numerical errors. This affected the 
   range of values in the result, and therefore the appearance of plots.
   {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.40-0}, december 2014)}

 \item \texttt{predict.slrm}:
   Results of \texttt{predict(object, newdata)} were incorrect 
   if the spatial domain of \texttt{newdata}
   was larger than the original domain.
   \bugger{1.21-0}{november 2010}{1.25-3}{february 2012}
   
 \item \texttt{Lest}:
   The variance approximations (Lotwick-Silverman and Ripley)
   obtained with \texttt{var.approx=TRUE} were incorrect for \texttt{Lest}
   (although they were correct for \texttt{Kest}) due to a coding error.
   \bugger{1.24-1}{october 2011}{1.24-2}{november 2011}
 
 \item \texttt{bw.diggle}:
   Bandwidth was too large by a factor of 2.
   \bugger{1.23-4}{september 2011}{1.23-5}{september 2011}
 
 \item pair correlation functions (\texttt{pcf.ppp}, \texttt{pcfdot}, 
    \texttt{pcfcross} etc:)
    The result had a negative bias at the maximum $r$ value,
    because contributions to the pcf estimate from interpoint distances
    greater than \texttt{max(r)} were mistakenly omitted. 
    {\small (Bugs fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.35-0}, december 2013)}
    
 \item \texttt{Kest}, \texttt{Lest}:
   Gave incorrect values in very large datasets, due to numerical overflow.
   `Very large' typically means about 1 million points in a random pattern, 
   or 100,000 points in a tightly clustered pattern.
   [Overflow cannot occur unless there are at least 46,341 points.]
   
 \item \texttt{bw.relrisk}:
    Implementation of \texttt{method="weightedleastsquares"} was incorrect

\item \texttt{triangulate.owin}:
   Results were incorrect in some special cases.
   \bugger{1.42-2}{june 2015}{1.44-0}{december 2015}
  
\item \texttt{crosspairs}:
   If \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} were identical point patterns,
   the result was not necessarily symmetric
   (on some machines) due to numerical artifacts.
   \bugger{1.35-0}{december 2013}{1.44-0}{december 2015}

 \item \texttt{bdist.tiles}:
   Values were incorrect in some cases due to numerical error.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.29-0}, october 2012)}
   
\item \texttt{Kest.fft}:
  Result was incorrectly normalised.
   \bugger{1.21-2}{january 2011}{1.44-0}{december 2015}
  
\item \texttt{crossdist.ppp}:
  Ignored argument \texttt{squared} if \texttt{periodic=FALSE}.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.38-0}, july 2014)}

\item polygon geometry:
    The point-in-polygon test gave the wrong answer in some boundary cases.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.23-2}, august 2011)}

\item \texttt{MultiStraussHard}:
    If a fitted model with \texttt{MultiStraussHard} interaction was invalid,
    \texttt{project.ppm} sometimes yielded a model that was still invalid.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.42-0}, may 2015)}
    
\item \texttt{pool.envelope}:  
  Did not always respect the value of \texttt{use.theory}.
    \bugger{1.23-5}{september 2011}{1.43-0}{september 2015}

\item \texttt{nncross.lpp}, \texttt{nnwhich.lpp}, \texttt{distfun.lpp}:
  Sometimes caused a segmentation fault.
    \bugger{1.44-0}{december 2015}{1.44-1}{december 2015}

\item \texttt{anova.ppm}:
  If a single \texttt{object} was given, and it was a Gibbs model,
  then \texttt{adjust} was effectively set to \texttt{FALSE}.
